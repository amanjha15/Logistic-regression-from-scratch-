# Logistic-regression-from-scratch-
This project demonstrates a complete implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using only NumPy in Python,avoids machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, focusing instead on the mathematical foundations of logistic regression.
Dataset-> Multiclass Diabetes Dataset
Achieved 92% and 100% accuracy for 2 classes using gradient descent and newtons method at 100 iterations showcasing the contrast between the 2 methods.
